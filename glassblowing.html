      One of my hobbies is actually my job. I work for a company called
      <a href="https://finearthl.com/" target="_blank"
        >Fine Art Hand Crafted Lighting.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Fine Art Handcrafted Lighting is driven to achieve the highest artistic
      standards by creating unique and original lighting designs of beautifully
      handcrafted metal, hand-blown glass, and other unique materials utilizing
      exquisite hand-applied finishes.

      I started working here back in 2017 with no glass blowing experience and
      slowly learned the art of glass blowing.

    <p>
      In my few years here ive learned to make a couple of cool things out of
      glass.
