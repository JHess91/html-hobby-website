      A big amount of my time has been spent in virtual worlds. competitive
      gaming world to be exact. I like games that reward you for winning and
      punishes you for losing. And while winning always feels good losing can be
      quite frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite games is called CS:GO or
      <a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank"
        >Counter-strike Global Offensive</a
      >. Counter strike has been around since the late 90's and has been updated
      and remade multiple times and ive been playing ever since.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a quick explanation of how the game is played</p>

      Not only is it one of my favorite games to play but its my favorite epsort
      to watch being played competitively. Ive also attend a tournament 3 years
      ago and was able to watch it live.

    <h1>Apex Legends</h1>

    />
    <p>
      Another one of my favorite games that ive recently picked up is Apex
      legends. This is a battle royal type game. 20 teams of 3 drop into the map
      and the last team standing wins. The available play area on the island
      shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves
      outside the play area which can be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like CSGO apex legends also has a ranked mode where playeds are rewarded
      for winning causing them to gain "RP" which when reached to a specific
      amount allows the player to move up in rank. Losing decreases "RP" which
      lowers your rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each "legend" has specific skill and ultimate ability that help your team
      throughout the game.

    <h1>League Of Legends</h1>

    <p>And then theres league of legends...</p>
    <p>
      If you like to rage then this game is for you. League of legends aka
      League aka LoL is MOBA type game (multiplayer online battle arena) In the
      game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat,
      each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten
      players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities
      and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more
      powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing
      items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift,
      a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their
      "Nexus", a large structure located within.
