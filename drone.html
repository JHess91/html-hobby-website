    <h1>FPV Drones</h1>
    <p>
      First Person View, or FPV, drone racing, is a sport where participants
      control "drones", equipped with cameras while wearing head-mounted
      displays showing the live stream camera feed from the drones. Similar to
      full size air racing, the goal is to complete a set course as quickly as
      possible.

    <h2>My drone time line</h2>
    <p>
      I first got into this hobby when I bought my first Photography Drone
      <a href="https://www.dji.com/spark">The DJI Spark.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After doing a little research I learn about FPV drones. There were quite a
      few differences when it came to the FPV drones
    </p>
    <p>
      For starters these things are fully customizable. All the way down to the
      type of motherboards and cameras you can install. Another thing that drew
      my attention was that I would no longer have to look at a screen to fly. I
      could now buy a VR like headset and fly it as if I was in the pilots seat
    </p>
    <p>
      But just like picking up any new hobby I was a noob. I had no idea where
      to even start when it came to building these things. So i bought a
      prebuilt one called

      Slowly but surely, Youtube video after youtube video I was able to build
      my first drone from scratch

    <p>
      After programming the whole thing it was now time to master flying it. I
      spent many hours in a flight simulator learning. Unlike the DJI Spark this
      drone did not have a self level or auto hover. Which mean my fingers have
      to be controlling this thing at all times. With no return to home button
      available on my custom drone meant I needed to learn to land which sounds
      easy but its a real challenge depending on where you wanted to land this
      thing

    <p>With a few months of practice this is what I can do</p>
